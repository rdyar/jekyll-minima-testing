just do it.

## Python 
### Python is a calculator first

Like many programming languages Python's first function is that of a calculator. 

```Python3
1 + 1 # Adding two numbers

```

This will return 2 since Python, like most programming languages functions as a cluculator first. You can also see that anything following a hashtag is a comment which means it will not be executed. There are other basic calculator function included as well.


```Python3
1 - 1  # Subtraction 1 minus 1
2 * 2  # Multiplication 2 times 2
4 / 2  # Division 4 divided by 2
4 ** 2 # To the power of. 4 squared

```

There are also more complicated calculator functions built into the the python framework.

```Python3
7 % 3  # Modulus ( Which divides and returns the remainder [ in this case 1 ] ) 
7 // 2 # Floor Division ( Which divides and rounds down [ in this case 3 ] )

```

You may also notice there is spaces between the numbers and the operators. This is purely aesthetic. You can have any number of spaces between values as long as they are on the same line. They will read in the same order as PEMDAS and from left to right otherwise. Parenthesis can be applied to functions as well. However, it may be more convenient to assign an operation to a variable which we will cover in a moment.


```Python3
# Python can also compare values
4 > 3 # Will return True
3 > 4 # Will return False

True
False
true
false

```
